1. **Create a new project directory**: Start by creating a new directory (folder) for your project:

   ```
   mkdir my_project
   cd my_project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment with venv**:

   ```
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   On Windows:

   ```
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On Unix or MacOS:

   ```
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install necessary Python packages**: Use pip to install any libraries or frameworks that you need for your project:

   ```
   pip install flask numpy pandas
   ```

   Of course, replace "flask numpy pandas" with the names of the packages you actually need.

5. **Generate a requirements.txt file**: Once you've installed all the packages you need, you can create a `requirements.txt` file, which is a list of all the Python packages required to run your project:

   ```
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

   The `pip freeze` command outputs a list of all installed packages and their versions. The `>` operator then writes this list to a file named `requirements.txt`.

6. **Write your code**: Now, you can write your Python code as you normally would. All Python packages that you install will be local to your virtual environment, not installed globally.

7. **Deactivate the virtual environment**: Once you're done working for now, you can deactivate your virtual environment:

   ```
   deactivate
   ```

8. **Initialize a Git repository**: To put your project on GitHub, you first need to initialize a Git repository in your project directory:

   ```
   git init
   ```

9. **Create a .gitignore file**: This step is crucial. We do not want to upload our entire virtual environment to GitHub. Create a file in your project directory named `.gitignore` and add the following line to it:

   ```
   myenv/
   ```

   This tells Git to ignore your virtual environment folder. You may also want to ignore other kinds of files, depending on your project. For Python projects, a common `.gitignore` file might look like this:

   ```
   # Ignore the virtual environment:
   myenv/

   # Ignore compiled Python files:
   *.pyc
   *.pyo
   *.pyd
   __pycache__/

   # Ignore Jupyter notebook checkpoint directories:
   .ipynb_checkpoints/
   ```

10. **Add files to the Git repository**: You can now add all your files (except the ones listed in `.gitignore`) to the Git repository:

    ```
    git add .
    ```

11. **Commit your changes**:

    ```
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

12. **Create a new repository on GitHub**: Log into GitHub, click on the "+" icon in the upper right corner and select "New repository". Name it, provide a description, set it to public (or private, if you prefer), and don't initialize it with a README (since you're pushing an existing repository).

13. **Link your local repository to the GitHub repository**: Replace `username` with your GitHub username and `repository` with the name of your new GitHub repository:

    ```
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
    ```

14. **Push your code to GitHub**:

    ```
    git push -u origin master
    ```
